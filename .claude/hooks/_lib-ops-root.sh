# _lib-ops-root.sh — shared OPS_ROOT discovery for hooks and skills.
#
# An "ops root" is the directory containing one of:
#
#   1. a `.apexyard-fork` marker file (v2 layout, framework ≥ #242), OR
#   2. BOTH `onboarding.yaml` AND `apexyard.projects.yaml` (legacy v1
#      layout — pre-v2 single-fork OR pre-v2 split-portfolio adopters).
#
# Hooks that write or read framework session state (`.claude/session/*`)
# need this to resolve consistently regardless of cwd. The failure mode
# is real: when the operator works inside a managed-project workspace
# clone at `workspace/<project>/`, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
# returns the project clone, NOT the ops fork. Hooks that wrote markers
# under the ops fork (e.g. via `require-active-ticket.sh`'s OPS_ROOT
# walk) ended up invisible to merge-gate hooks that resolved REPO_ROOT
# via plain `git rev-parse`.
#
# Why a marker file: split-portfolio v2 (#242) moves both `onboarding.yaml`
# AND `apexyard.projects.yaml` to the private sibling repo. The legacy
# walk-up condition (BOTH files at the candidate dir) is no longer
# satisfied by the public fork, so we need a presence-only anchor that
# survives the move. `.apexyard-fork` is written by `/setup` at first
# run and by `/update` during the v2 migration. Single-fork adopters
# also benefit from the marker (set by `/setup`) but the legacy walk
# remains a fallback for un-migrated forks.
#
# Functions:
#   resolve_ops_root [start_dir]
#       Walks up from start_dir (default: $PWD) toward / looking for a
#       directory that satisfies either anchor condition.
#       Echoes the path on success; echoes nothing and returns 0 on miss
#       (caller is expected to fall back to start_dir or a sensible
#       default).
#
# Sourced by hooks; never executed directly.
